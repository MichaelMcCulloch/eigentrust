# Specification Quality Checklist: EigenTrust P2P Trust Algorithm Demonstration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

**Validation Summary**:
- 5 user stories prioritized from P1 (foundation) to P5 (advanced)
- 15 functional requirements covering network creation, algorithm execution, and visualization
- 7 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- 7 edge cases identified
- 5 key entities defined
- Assumptions documented
- No clarification markers needed (all aspects have reasonable defaults)
